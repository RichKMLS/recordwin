## Why use this script?
Creating high-quality GIFs can be a time-consuming and complex process. This script simplifies the process by automating the steps involved in recording the window, generating a color palette, and creating the final GIF.

The script uses ffmpeg to record the screen and overlay it as a curved rectangle over a background color #0d1117 (the dark theme of a github readme). It then generates a color palette from the recorded video to optimize the quality of the resulting GIF. Finally, it uses the generated color palette to create a high-quality GIF from the recorded video which opens automatically once created.

## How to use this script
To use this script, follow these steps:

Make sure you have ffmpeg and xwininfo installed on your system. If you donâ€™t have them installed, you can install them using the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg x11-utils
```
Save the script to a file on your system, for example window-to-gif.sh.

Make the script executable by running the following command:
```bash
chmod +x wubuntuwin2gif
```
Run the script by executing it from the command line:
```bash
./ubuntuwin2gif
```
Click the window you want to record and the script will start. 

Use ctrl+C on your terminal to end recording.

Once the script completes, it will generate a high-quality GIF of the selected window and save it to your system and open it automatically.
